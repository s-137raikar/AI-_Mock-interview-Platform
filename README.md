This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## üöÄ Project Overview  
**SmartHire** is an **AI-powered Mock Interview System** that delivers a **realistic, voice-enabled interview experience** for candidates preparing for technical and HR rounds.  
Built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Firebase**, and **Vapi Voice AI SDK**, the platform simulates human-like conversations, evaluates responses, and provides detailed AI-generated feedback on communication, technical accuracy, and confidence.

This project bridges the gap between **interview preparation** and **AI-driven evaluation**, making practice sessions more interactive, adaptive, and insightful.

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Enable **AI-based mock interviews** with both text and voice interaction.  
- Automate **feedback generation** using **Gemini LLM** for content analysis.  
- Provide **real-time conversation flow** powered by **Vapi‚Äôs Voice AI SDK**.  
- Deliver a scalable and modern **full-stack web experience** using **Next.js + Firebase**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture  
SmartHire integrates multiple modules that work seamlessly:  
1. **User Interface (Next.js + Tailwind):** Handles user authentication, interview creation, and feedback visualization.  
2. **Vapi Integration:** Provides **real-time voice processing**, enabling two-way AI communication between the user and system.  
3. **Gemini AI:** Generates adaptive questions, analyzes responses, and produces personalized interview feedback.  
4. **Firebase:** Manages secure authentication, data storage, and session management.

## üß† Updated Implementation ‚Äì Vapi Workflows  
Vapi recently introduced an update to their **Workflows** feature ‚Äî you no longer need to create an Assistant and attach a Workflow through the dashboard.  
Now, Workflows can be **built and managed directly within your application** using the **Vapi Web SDK**, allowing full programmatic control and faster iteration.  

We‚Äôve implemented this updated method in SmartHire, and shared a detailed example on our Learning Platform for community use.
